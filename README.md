Intercept API for Bose SoundTouch after they turn off the servers

## Background
[Bose has announced that they are shutting down the servers for the SoundTouch system in February, 2026. ](https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life) When those servers go away, certain network-based functionality currently available to SoundTouch devices will stop working.

This is an attempt to reverse-engineer those servers so that users can continue to use the full set of SoundTouch functionality after Bose shuts the official servers down.

### Context

[As described here](https://flarn2006.blogspot.com/2014/09/hacking-bose-soundtouch-and-its-linux.html), it is possible to access the underlying server by creating a USB stick with an empty file called **remote_services** and then booting the SoundTouch with the USB stick plugged in to the USB port in the back. From there we can then telnet (or ssh, but the ssh server running is fairly old) over and log in as root (no password).

### Pointing the Bose Speaker to a Local Server

Once logged into the speaker, you can go to `/opt/Bose/etc` and look at the file `SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml`:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg>
	  <margeServerUrl>https://streaming.bose.com</margeServerUrl>
	  <statsServerUrl>https://events.api.bosecm.com</statsServerUrl>
	  <swUpdateUrl>https://worldwide.bose.com/updates/soundtouch</swUpdateUrl>
	  <usePandoraProductionServer>true</usePandoraProductionServer>
	  <isZeroconfEnabled>true</isZeroconfEnabled>
	  <saveMargeCustomerReport>false</saveMargeCustomerReport>
	  <bmxRegistryUrl>https://content.api.bose.io/bmx/registry/v1/services</bmxRegistryUrl>
	</SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg>

Assumingly all four servers listed there will be shut down. From testing, the `marge` server is necessary for basic network functionality, and the `bmx` server seems to be required for TuneIn radio.

To point your system to another server, simple enter into read-write mode, edit the file (vi is available) and replace the URLs with your local URLs, and then reboot

	root@spotty:etc# rw                            
	root@spotty:etc# vi SoundTouchSdkPrivateCfg.xml
	root@spotty:etc# reboot
